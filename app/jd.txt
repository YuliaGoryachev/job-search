The companyNebius AI is an AI-centric public cloud platform specifically crafted to serve AI models for training and inference.Our mission is to help ML 
practitioners concentrate on their core jobs, while DevOps, MLOps, and infrastructure-related tasks are handled by us. The idea is to build an ML-specific cloud 
platform covering the entire ML lifecycle from A to Z: from data preparation and labeling to ML training and inference.We recognize the potential of ML and AI 
technologies and aim to provide our future users with the perfect environment to train and fine-tune their models. We are committed to delivering the best user 
experience and excellent customer support.\nFour development hubs:Nebius is headquartered in the Netherlands, with hubs in Finland, Serbia, and Israel.\nData center 
in Europe:Our own data center in Finland features server racks designed in-house for ML-specific high load, with power-efficient solutions, including a free-cooling 
system.\n500+ professionals:Our mature team of engineers has a proven track record in developing sophisticated cloud and ML solutions and designing cutting-edge 
hardware.\n\nOur TeamNebius' Large Language Models (LLM) team is dedicated to pushing the boundaries of language modelling technology.\nWe are focused on developing 
a state-of-the-art LLM technological stack that spans foundational model training and web-scale data collection. Our overarching objective is to pioneer 
cutting-edge language generation technology for both internal use and customer applications, driving the evolution of the next generation of AI-powered 
products.\n\nThe RoleWe are currently in search of Staff Machine Learning (ML) engineers with exceptional skill sets and a passion for large language models. Your 
invaluable contributions will play a pivotal role in shaping our advanced LLM stack.\n\nIn this position, your responsibility will be to:Conduct experiments with 
innovative deep learning methods to improve our models.Explore techniques to enhance of our pretraining and alignment data.\n\nWe expect you to have:5+ years 
experience in a Machine Learning or AI related roleSubstantial industrial or academic experience with large language models and generative AI.A profound 
understanding of the theoretical foundations of machine learning.Familiarity with modern deep learning frameworks such as TensorFlow, PyTorch, or JAX.Proficiency in 
contemporary software engineering approaches, including CI/CD, version control, and unit testing.A commitment to maintaining extreme rigor in all job-related 
activities.\n\nIt would be an added bonus if you had:Previous experience working with language models or other similar NLP technologies.Track record of building and 
delivering products (not necessarily ML-related) in a dynamic startup-like environment.Strong engineering skills, including experience in developing large 
distributed systems or high-load web services.Open-source projects that showcase your engineering prowess.\n\nDoes all that sound like your kind of challenge? Then
